        Don't go tonight                <br>
        Stay here one more time         <br>    
        Remind me what it's like, oh    <br>
        And let's fall in love one more time            <br>
        I need you now by my side                   <br>
        It tears me up when you turn me down            <br>
        I'm begging please, just stick around               <br>
        
        I'm sorry, don't leave me, I want you here with me  <br>
        I know that your love is gone               <br>
        I can't breathe, I'm so weak, I know this isn't easy        <br>
        Don't tell me that your love is gone            <br>
        That your love is gone              <br>
        
        I'm sorry, don't leave me, I want you here with me          <br>
        I know that your love is gone                       <br>
        I can't breathe, I'm so weak, I know this isn't easy            <br>
        Don't tell me that your love is gone                <br>
        That your love is gone              <br>

        Don't tell me that your love is gone, that your love is gone    <br>
        Don't tell me that your love is gone, that your love is gone    <br>
        
        That your love is gone              <br>
        I know this isn't easy (Easy)       <br>
        That your love is gone          <br>
