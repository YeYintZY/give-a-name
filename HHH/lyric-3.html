        <center><h5>Gimme, gimme, gimme some time to think <br>
            I'm in the bathroom, looking at me <br>
            Face in the mirror is all I need (ooh) <br>
            Wait until the reaper takes my life <br>
            Never gonna get me out alive <br>
            I will live a thousand million lives (ooh) <br>

            My patience is waning <br>
            Is this entertaining? <br>
            Our patience is waning <br>
            Is this entertaining? <br>

            I-I-I got this feeling, yeah, you know <br>
            Where I'm losing all control <br>
            'Cause there's magic in my bones <br>
            I-I-I got this feeling in my soul <br>
            Go ahead and throw your stones <br>
            'Cause there's magic in my bones <br>

            Playing with a stick of dynamite <br>
            There was never gray in black and white <br>
            There was never wrong 'til there was right (ooh, ah-ooh) <br>
            Feeling like a boulder hurtling <br>
            Seeing all the vultures circling <br>
            Burning in the flames I'm working in <br>
            Turning in a bed that's darkening <br>

            My patience is waning <br>
            Is this entertaining? <br>

            'Cause there's magic in my bones <br>

            Look in the mirror of my mind <br>
            Turning the pages of my life <br>
            Walking the path so many paced a million times <br>
            Drown out the voices in the air <br> 
            Leaving the ones that never cared <br>
            Picking the pieces up and building to the sky <br>

            My patience is waning <br>
            Is this entertaining? <br>

            'Cause there's magic in my bones <br>

            There goes my mind (I-I-I) <br>
            Don't mind <br>
            There goes my mind (there it goes, there it goes) <br>
            There goes my mind (I-I-I) <br>
            Don't mind (there it goes) <br>
            There goes my mind <br>
            'Cause there's magic in my bones</h5></center>
