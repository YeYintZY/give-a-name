        <center><h5>We couldn't turn around <br>
                   'Til we were upside down <br>
                    I'll be the bad guy now <br>
                    But, no, I ain't too proud <br>

                    I couldn't be there <br>
                    Even when I tried <br>
                    You don't believe it <br>
                    We do this every time <br>

                    Seasons change and our love went cold <br>
                    Feed the flame 'cause we can't let it go <br>
                    Run away, but we're running in circles <br>
                    Run away, run away <br>

                    I dare you to do something <br>
                    I'm waiting on you again <br>
                    So I don't take the blame <br>
                    Run away, but we're running in circles <br>
                    Run away, run away, run away <br>

                    Let go <br>
                    I got a feeling that it's time to let go <br>

                    I say so <br>
                    I knew that this was doomed from the get-go <br>

                    You thought that it was special, special <br>
                    But it was just the sex though, the sex though <br>
                    And I still hear the echoes (the echoes) <br>
                    I got a feeling that it's time to let it go, let it go <br>

                    Seasons change and our love went cold <br>

                    Maybe you don't understand what I'm going through <br>
                    It's only me <br>
                    What you got to lose? <br>
                    Make up your mind, tell me <br>
                    What are you gonna do? <br>
                    It's only me <br>
                    Let it go <br>
