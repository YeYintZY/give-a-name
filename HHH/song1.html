        Can I call you baby? Can you be my friend?      <br>
        Can you be my lover up until the very end?          <br>
        Let me show you love, oh, no pretend                    <br>
        Stick by my side even when the world is caving in, yeah     <br>
        
        Oh, oh, oh, don't, don't you worry                  <br>
        I'll be there whenever you want me                  <br>
        
        I need somebody who can love me at my worst         <br>
        No, I'm not perfect, but I hope you see my worth        <br>
        'Cause it's only you, nobody new, I put you first       <br>
        And for you, girl, I swear I'd do the worst             <br>
        
        Ooh, ooh-ooh                    <br>
        Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh    <br>
        
        If you stay forever, let me hold your hand          <br>
        I can fill those places in your heart no one else can       <br>
        Let me show you love, oh, no pretend, yeah                      <br>
        I'll be right here, baby, you know it's sink or swim        <br>
        
        Oh, oh, oh, don't, don't you worry              <br>
        I'll be there whenever you want me              <br>
